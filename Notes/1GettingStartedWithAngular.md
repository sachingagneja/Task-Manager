## Angular Overview

### What is Angular?
- **Angular** is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. 
- Developed and maintained by Google.
- It is the successor to AngularJS, designed to address the limitations of its predecessor and to provide a more modern, efficient way to build applications.

### Popularity
- Angular is widely used, especially in enterprise-level applications due to its robust feature set and scalability.
- It's well-regarded for creating dynamic, high-performance front-end applications.

### Differences Between Angular and AngularJS
- **AngularJS** (also known as Angular 1.x) is the original version of Angular, using JavaScript.
- **Angular** (also known as Angular 2+ or just Angular) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, built with TypeScript, and offers a more modular and modern framework.

## Why Use Angular?
1. **Dynamic Frontend Apps**: Provides a powerful way to create dynamic, interactive single-page applications.
2. **Full-Featured Framework**: Includes essential tools such as a router for navigation and HTTP services for communication.
3. **TypeScript Integration**: Optionally integrates TypeScript, providing static typing, classes, and interfaces.
4. **RxJS**: Utilizes RxJS for handling asynchronous operations efficiently.
5. **Test Friendly**: Built with testing in mind, making it easy to write unit and end-to-end tests.
6. **Popular in Enterprise Business**: Favored by many large enterprises for its scalability and robust toolset.

## Key Concepts

### Angular Components
- **Components** are the building blocks of Angular applications.
- Each component consists of:
  - **Template**: Defines the view, which is a user interface.
  - **Class**: Contains the logic and data.
  - **Metadata**: Decorators that provide additional information about the component.

### Angular Services
- **Services** are used to share data and functionality across different parts of an application.
- Typically used for:
  - Fetching data from a server
  - Implementing business logic
  - Providing utility functions

### Angular CLI
- **Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.
- Commands include:
  - `ng new` to create a new Angular application.
  - `ng generate` to create components, services, and other Angular constructs.
  - `ng build` to build the application for deployment.
  - `ng serve` to run the application locally during development.

### `ng serve`
- A command used to compile the application and start a development server.
- Automatically watches for file changes and rebuilds the application as needed.
- Commonly used for testing and development purposes.
